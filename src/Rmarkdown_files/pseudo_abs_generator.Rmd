### ***Pseudo-absences generator function***

Aiming to determine the spatial distribution of the landrace group, the model need some points(locations, coordinates) from where to compare against the occurrences. Such points are known as pseudo-absences and are chosen randomly, they have to encompass a wide variety of environments over the extent.

This Function implements two different methods to select points randomly over the geographic area, and also to extract the values from the variables(Crop diversity drivers) and compile them into a single CSV file. After generating all pesudo-absences the correlation between crop diversity drivers is evaluated and the most correlated variables will be removed in order to avoid model multicolinearity problems.
